## How is it done?

You might be wondering on how graphs were plotted on raw dataset is done, well it aint that complicated as you may think.

We all all know that computer are good at numbers, so in order to plot graph we were designing a definite structure to the data in this case
we used dictionaries , for plotting graph we used matplotlib .

This repo consist of a basic example on how to do that.


## Getting started

To get started with the code on this repo, you need to either *clone* or *download* this repo into your machine just as shown below;

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:mountblue/cohort-16-python/gopinath_v/dataproject-python.git
```

## Dependencies 

Before you begin playing with the source code you might need to install the following libaries just as shown below;

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Running the App

To run this code you need to have your textual document in your project directory with extension **.txt** and then when you run the script, it will automatically loads all the document with that extension and then compute the similarity between them just as shown below;

```bash
$-> cd Plagiarism-checker-Python
$ Plagiarism-checker-Python-> python3 app.py
('john.txt', 'juma.txt', 0.5465972177348937)
('fatma.txt', 'john.txt', 0.14806887549598566)
('fatma.txt', 'juma.txt', 0.18643448370323362)

```
