## How is it done?

You might be wondering on how graphs were plotted on raw dataset is done, well it aint that complicated as you may think.

We all all know that computer are good at numbers, so in order to plot graph we were designing a definite structure to the data in this case
we used dictionaries , for plotting graph we used matplotlib .

This repo consist of a basic example on how to do that.
